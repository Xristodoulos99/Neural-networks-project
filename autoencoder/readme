Project 3

In this project an autoencoder was used on the dataset (MNIST HANDWRITEN DIGITS) in order to try to clear the images or remove to noise.
The idea was to try and pass those digits later to the NN of the first project to see if passing clearer data though that gives a better result.
Encoder was compared with a PCA as well.

At the end the clear data were given to the NN with 2 ways: As a training set only, and as a testing set only(with the nn having trained on the default ones)
