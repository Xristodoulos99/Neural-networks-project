This project's idea was not to create a SVM from scratch like the first one, but to implement the one from SKLEARN and play around its variables 
to make usefull conclusions as to what effects what.
The SVM is used to classify even and odd numbers of the mnist dataset(handwriten digits)

Then the svm is compated with the knn methods from the 1st project
